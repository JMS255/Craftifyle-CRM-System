## CRM Current Status (June 1, 2026 — after full-day build session)

### Everything that's working

**Pipeline & Leads**
- Lead pipeline: new → contacted → quoted → negotiating → booked → lost → completed
- Kanban board view (drag-and-drop on desktop, single-column + stage tabs on mobile)
- AI next-action badges per lead: "⚡ Event in 3d — confirm!", "🔔 Follow up now", "📞 First contact needed", "⚠ Event passed"
- Cold lead alerts banner — leads silent 5+ days, color-coded warm/cold/very cold
- Next-action badges also in kanban cards
- Package name shown on lead table rows

**Bookings & Payments**
- Booking management with deposit/balance tracking
- Payment status badges per booking: Unpaid / Deposit Paid / Fully Paid / Overdue
- Overdue alert banner on bookings page (event passed, balance unpaid)
- Micro-animation on Mark Paid — green flash confirmation banner
- Invoice generator (printable PDF) with line-item add-ons

**Dashboard**
- Revenue card: this month confirmed / collected / outstanding
- Today's Actions card — top 3 urgent leads, click to navigate
- Quick-prompt chips: Paste DM · What needs attention · Revenue · Draft follow-up
- Onboarding checklist (shown to new users with no leads, progress bar, dismissible)
- Charts: bookings/month bar chart + lead source donut

**Crafty AI — two modes**
- Advisor tab → `/api/chat` — Groq llama-3.1-8b-instant, business advice, no DB access
- CRM Actions tab → `/api/crafty-assist` — Groq llama-3.3-70b-versatile with tool calling
- Both know today's date (injected at request time)
- Pulse animation + tooltip on first 3 sessions (discoverability)
- External event trigger: `window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('crafty-prompt', { detail: { prompt, mode } }))`

**Crafty Tools (CRM Actions)**
- get_leads, create_lead, update_lead
- get_bookings, create_booking, log_payment
- get_revenue_summary, convert_lead_to_booking, get_urgent_leads

**Chat Widget Features**
- Paste DM — 📋 button opens panel, paste raw Messenger inquiry, Crafty creates lead
- Mode toggle: Advisor / CRM Actions (each keeps separate message history)
- Quick-prompt chips on dashboard fire Crafty prompts via CustomEvent

**UX Improvements (June 1)**
- Onboarding checklist for new users (3 steps + progress bar)
- Progressive lead form — 4 fields by default, "Add more details +" expands rest
- Mobile Quick Add "+" in bottom nav → sheet: Add Lead, Paste DM, Log Payment
- Follow-up templates on lead detail — 3 Taglish messages + "Open Messenger" deep link
- Custom empty states: Leads, Bookings pages with illustrated CTAs
- Paste DM promoted as #1 entry point on empty leads page
- Mobile kanban: stage tab bar + single column + "Move to →" buttons

**Package Builder**
- PackagePicker component — 4 package cards + add-ons (togglable), auto-calculates total
- Add-ons saved in booking package_name field (e.g. "Photobooth + Photography + Magnet prints")
- Invoice shows add-ons as line items
- Crafty uses exact package prices by name

**Booking Confirmation Smart Link**
- Public page `/confirm/[token]` — no login needed
- Shows: event details, package breakdown, GCash 0993-632-4512, terms
- "🔗 Share Link" button on booking detail copies the URL

**Automation**
- Semaphore SMS follow-up — cron sends Taglish SMS to leads with phone numbers
- SEMAPHORE_API_KEY: 75a671289eda9b6b08a32fe272f80292 (set in .env.local, NEEDS Vercel env var too)
- Auto follow-up cron (Vercel Cron) + 3-day booking reminders
- Google Calendar sync on bookings

**Auth**
- Open beta ready: delete INVITE_CODE from Vercel env → anyone can sign up
- Signup page auto-skips invite step if open beta is on

## What to Build Next

### Immediate
1. **SEMAPHORE_API_KEY** — add to Vercel env vars (value: 75a671289eda9b6b08a32fe272f80292)
2. **UI Redesign** — see full spec below. Start with Polish Pass (8 hrs) before committing to Full Redesign (22 hrs)
3. **Skipped UX items** — C4 swipe-to-action, C6 Facebook Login, H7 optimistic UI, N1–N6 nice-to-haves

### After UI polish
4. **PayMongo payment links** — when James can sign up
5. **Crafty AI training UI** — configure packages/pricing from app
6. **Booking contracts + e-sign**
7. **Client portal**

## UI Redesign Spec (from June 1 research)

**Core problem:** Token inconsistency (half app uses hardcoded `bg-white`/`text-gray-900`, other half uses CSS vars) + no design identity.

**Accent shift:** `#6366f1` → `#7c6ff7` (slightly warmer violet, same family, looks intentional not default)

**Dark surface ladder (no shadows — borders only):**
- Page: `#09090f` · Card: `#0f0f17` · Sidebar: `#141420` · Hover: `#1a1a2a` · Active: `#1f1f33`

**Border system (opacity-based):**
- Subtle: `rgba(255,255,255,0.05)` · Default: `rgba(255,255,255,0.08)` · Strong: `rgba(255,255,255,0.14)`

**Typography fixes:**
- Body: 15px (not 16px) · Headings: weight 600, letter-spacing -0.015em
- ALL CAPS labels: 11px weight 500 letter-spacing 0.08em
- Add `font-feature-settings: "calt", "liga", "kern"` to base CSS

**Border radius — 3 tiers only:**
- 6px: badges, inputs · 10px: buttons · 14px: all cards · 9999px: pills
- Kill `rounded-xl` (12px) and `rounded-2xl` (16px) — replace with 14px

**Key micro-details:**
- Inset top border on dark cards: `box-shadow: inset 0 1px 0 rgba(255,255,255,0.06)`
- 150ms transitions on everything (not 300ms)
- Primary text: `#f4f4f6` not pure `#ffffff`
- 1px card lift on hover: `transform: translateY(-1px)`
- Remove all vertical table borders
- Skeleton loaders instead of spinners

**Filipino context:**
- Add amber `#f59e0b` as secondary accent (prosperity/craftsmanship associations)
- Light mode warm white: `#fafaf8` not cold `#ffffff`
- Minimum 12px text always

## Market Position (from June 2 research)

- PH CRM market: **$134.7M, growing 13.19% per year**
- **Craftifyle is the only Filipino-built CRM for service solopreneurs** — zero direct competitors in this niche
- 47–70% of CRM deployments in PH fail due to poor tool fit — Craftifyle's out-of-the-box setup is the fix
- Real competition is NOT Zoho/HubSpot — it's **Messenger + Google Sheets** (inertia from below)
- The #1 lost-lead cause in PH: response latency. Crafty AI + SMS directly solves this.
- Eventchy (Metro Manila marketplace) is a **partner opportunity**, not a competitor
- Positioning: "Filipino-built, peso-priced, pre-built for your business type"
- Zamboanga/Visayas/Mindanao are completely underserved — every competitor is Metro Manila-focused
- Full competitive analysis: craftycrm-website Research → Market Research tab

## Target Market Expansion (not photobooth-only)

The photobooth niche is the beachhead — but the real market is all Filipino service solopreneurs:
- Photographers, videographers
- Florists, caterers, event stylists
- Wedding coordinators, hosts, emcees
- Hair and makeup artists
- Any solo service business managing leads + bookings + invoices via Messenger

Pricing model: Free (hook) → ₱800/mo Starter → ₱1,200/mo Pro → Custom bespoke builds (₱30K–₱80K)

## Business Context

- GCash number: 0993-632-4512
- Debt: ₱32,990 due June 5, 2026
- June events: June 4, 5, 14, 28
- Lifetime ROAS: ₱9,800 ad spend → ₱54,250 revenue (5.5x)
- Plan: resume ads at ₱150/day after June 5 pointing to website
- Referral system launched June 1 on portfolio site
