## UI Design System (as of June 2, 2026)

**Accent:** `#7c6ff7` (warm violet)  
**Dark surface ladder:** Page `#09090f` · Card `#0f0f17` · Sidebar `#141420` · Hover `#1a1a2a` · Active `#1f1f33`  
**Border system:** Subtle `rgba(255,255,255,0.05)` · Default `rgba(255,255,255,0.08)` · Strong `rgba(255,255,255,0.14)`  
**Typography:** Body 15px · Headings weight 600, letter-spacing -0.015em · ALL CAPS labels 11px weight 500  
**Border radius:** 6px badges/inputs · 10px buttons · 14px cards · 9999px pills  
**Transitions:** 150ms on all interactive elements  
**Card detail:** `box-shadow: inset 0 1px 0 rgba(255,255,255,0.06)`

**Phase 1 ✅** — Token unification, new accent, card inset shadow, `.card` + `.section-label` classes, sidebar active state  
**Phase 2 ✅** — Global table system, typography letter-spacing, button press scale + focus ring, mobile nav backdrop-blur, `.tabular` number class  
**Phase 3 ✅** — `ads/page.tsx`, `personal/page.tsx`, `login/page.tsx`, `signup/page.tsx` full token pass. All pages now use CSS vars exclusively. `profile/page.tsx` was already clean.  
**Phase 4 ✅** — Skeleton loaders on all pages. `.skeleton` shimmer animation in globals.css. Dashboard, leads, bookings, lead detail, booking detail, invoice, ads, personal all replaced.

**UI Redesign: COMPLETE ✅**

---

## Roadmap

### Immediate
- Add `SEMAPHORE_API_KEY` to Vercel env vars
- UI Redesign Phase 4 — skeleton loaders (only remaining item)

### Sprint 2 (July 2026)
- Custom package builder in UI — configure from app without code
- Crafty AI training UI — set packages, pricing, personality from app

### Sprint 3 (August 2026)
- GCash / PayMongo payment links — auto-generate per booking, webhook marks deposit paid
- Unified conversations inbox — all Messenger threads in one place
- Booking contracts + e-sign

### Future
- Client portal — clients view booking, download invoice, see payment status
- Instagram DM bot — alternative intake while Messenger API is pending
- Facebook Ads API integration — real spend, CPC, ROI per campaign
- Mobile app (React Native)
- White-label SaaS — resell Crafty CRM under your own brand

### Vision

photographers, videographers, florists, caterers, hair & makeup, event stylists, hosts.
Target: ₱800/mo Starter → ₱1,200/mo Pro → Custom bespoke builds (₱30K–₱80K).
